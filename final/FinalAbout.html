          <h1 class="centert">Diving is a very versatile sport. Here is some info about diving!</h1>
          <p>Explained briefly, scuba diving is a water sport that involves breathing air from a tank while underwater.<br> Scuba is an acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.

            Most scuba divers are recreational divers who explore underwater environments such as lakes, rivers, quarries, kelp forests and coral reefs. There are also people who scuba dive for work including public safety divers, marine biologists and many others.</p>

            <h2>How is scuba diving done? </h2>
            <p>
                There’s more to scuba diving than just strapping a tank on your back and jumping in the water. It all starts with a dive plan. 
                
                You might choose the dive site and invite friends, or a dive buddy might message you, “conditions are going to be great this weekend!” Either way, your plan should include diving with at least one other person in case anything goes wrong underwater. If you don’t have a dive buddy, the local dive shop can help you find one.
                
                Once you decide where you want to dive and for how long, you’ll choose the appropriate scuba equipment. For example:
                
                If you plan to make multiple dives, you’ll want extra scuba tanks.
                When diving in cold water, many divers wear a dry suit instead of a wetsuit to stay warm.
                If the dive site is a shore dive, you may need a dive float.
                Many divers own their own scuba gear and either rent tanks or get their tanks filled at a local shop. Others rent all their diving equipment. Watch this video to learn more about how scuba gear works.
                
                When the dive day arrives, you’ll check the dive conditions one more time. If everything looks good, you’ll head to the dock or dive site with your gear.
