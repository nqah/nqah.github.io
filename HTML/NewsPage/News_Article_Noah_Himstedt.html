<body> In september, many Mexican schools go back to school from summer break. In this area, there are several major
     schools going back, and this has drastically changed traffic and mobility within the cities. Sit back and relax
     while reading. Today, we are going to
     talk about this, and more, on your <i>Daily News.</i> </body>

<h2> Schools reopen, less traffic?</h2>

<body> In recent years, we have seen an increase of visitors and traffic during the summer here in the <b>Riviera
          Maya.</b> The conclusion is obvious. While there are more tourists in summer, there are also way more school
     kids that have summer vacation. They come from all over the country with their families to have a great vacation in
     the tropical <b> Riviera Maya.</b> Once the school starts back up, many families will go back because their kids
     have to go to school, and we see the roads clear up. This isn't just true for travelers though, but also for
     locals. Once many kids go back to school, waterparks and amusement park will get less full. As well as the parks,
     so will the beaches.

<h2>The beaches are full!</h2>

<body>The beaches in the <b>Riviera Maya</b> are some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Millions of tourists
     go and visit these every single year. But if there is more people, there is also more pollution and more chance of
     someone getting hurt. In the summer, many beaches are crowded and polluted because of the trash so many people
     leave at the beach. <q>The city is actively working on this</q>, says the mayor. As we heard the city is trying to
     work on solutions for this problem, as it gets worse and worse.</body>
